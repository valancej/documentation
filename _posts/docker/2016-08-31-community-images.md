Codeship community members can develop and maintain base images that they may want to share with other Docker users.  

These may make a great fit for your projects, although *troubleshooting with these images may be limited if available at all as they are not officially maintained by Codeship*.

Of course, our standard support is available regardless of what base images  you are using!
