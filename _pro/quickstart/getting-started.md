## Getting Started With Codeship Pro (Part 1)

We’re going to walk you through using Codeship Pro to build, test, and deploy your applications. Codeship Pro uses Docker to define your CI/CD environment and run your build pipeline. We chose Docker because it’s a well-known and documented standard, but your application itself does not need to be “fully Dockerized” to make use of Codeship Pro’s benefits. As long as you can build containers for your application, Codeship Pro will let you run a flexible, powerful CI/CD pipeline.

Additionally, Codeship Pro uses a complimentary command-line tool called Jet to help you encrypt your secrets, as well as to debug and troubleshoot locally for a much faster feedback cycle.

The first thing you want to do is [install the Jet CLI]({% link _pro/jet-cli/installation.md %}) on your local machine. For Mac users, you can do this through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and Linux users can curl the Jet CLI binary directly.

## Testing Jet

Once Jet is installed, type `jet version` to print the version number on screen. Next, type `jet help` to bring up the help options. Jet is very powerful - from running CI to encrypting your credentials, so take some time to play around with what you see when you run `jet help`.

## Make A Simple Ruby Script

Now that we have Jet installed, we're going to take a few minutes and build a simple little "app". This isn't a real app, we're just going to write a little Ruby script and a Dockerfile to use as case studies. We'll expand on them later on.

First, create a file called `check.rb`. In that file we're just going to print our Postgres and Redis versions. If you're wondering how we're printing versions of tools we haven't set up - we'll get there.

In `check.rb`, just write and save the following code:

```ruby
require "redis"
require "pg"

def exit_if_not(expected, current)
  puts "Expected: #{expected}"
  puts "Current: #{current}"
  exit(1) if expected != current
end

puts "Redis"
redis = Redis.new(host: "redis")
puts "REDIS VERSION: #{redis.info["redis_version"]}"

sleep 4
postgres_username = "postgres"
postgres_password = ""
test = PG.connect("postgres", 5432, "", "", "postgres", postgres_username, postgres_password)
puts test.exec("SELECT version();").first["version"]
```

## Create Your Dockerfile

Next we're going to create a Dockerfile. Since Codeship Pro uses Docker as a standardized domain language, you'll need at least a minimal Dockerfile to get going. If you're already building your application with Docker, this will require very little (if any) adjustment - and if you're not using Docker, creating a basic container to run your application should work just fine.

If you're not familiar with Dockerfiles, and you want to spend a little bit of time getting up to speed on Docker, we highly recommend using these resources as a jumping-off point.

- [Docker's Getting Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
- [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [The Docker Ecosystem](https://blog.codeship.com/understanding-the-docker-ecosystem/)

Once you're ready to get going, create an empty Dockerfile and paste this code into it:

```dockerfile
# base on latest ruby base image
FROM ruby:2.5.0

# update and install dependencies
RUN apt-get update -qq
RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y build-essential libpq-dev nodejs apt-utils

# setup app folders
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

# copy over Gemfile and install bundle
ADD Gemfile /app/Gemfile
ADD Gemfile.lock /app/Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle install --jobs 20 --retry 5

Add . /app
```

As you can see here, we're pulling the Ruby base image, creating some directories, installing some gems, and then adding our code. That last bit is important because now when we launch our Docker container, the `check.rb` script we wrote earlier will be inside it and ready to run.

We have also referenced a `Gemfile` that you should go ahead and create as well:

```ruby
# Gemfile
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '2.5.0'

gem 'redis'
gem 'pg'
```

Once saved, run the following Docker command to generate the corresponding `Gemfile.lock`:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app ruby:2.5.0 bundle lock
```

## Define Your Services

So, now we have a script, we have a Docker container that includes this script... now what?

Well, we want to orchestrate our app (which means build the Dockerfile we just created), as well as build containers for Postgres and Redis. Remember, the script we wrote prints version numbers for Postgres and Redis, so we're going to need those services to be able to run it.

On Codeship Pro, you define the services you want to build by creating a `codeship-services.yml` file. This is a simple file that lives in your repo and tells Codeship what infrastructure and services to use. If you're familiar with Docker Compose, we lean heavily on the syntax and options of a standard Compose file. If you're not familiar with Docker Compose, [you can learn a bit more about it here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

One big difference between a standard Compose file and a `codeship-services.yml` file is that a Compose file is typically built to run your application, whereas your `codeship-services.yml` file will also define services you need just for CI/CD as well (such as deployment containers).

So, once you've created a file named `codeship-services.yml` go ahead and add the following code to it:

```yaml
demo:
  build:
    image: myapp
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  depends_on:
    - redis
    - postgres
redis:
  image: healthcheck/redis:alpine
postgres:
  image: healthcheck/postgres:alpine
```

The first thing this file does is define our *demo* service. It *builds* the Dockerfile and names it *myapp*. The `depends_on` section tells it what services are required for *demo* to run. In this case both *redis* and *postgres*.

Since we reference *redis* and *postgres*, we need to define them as separate services as well. For each, we provide an image - we could build one using separate Dockerfiles but instead we're going to download existing repos from a Docker registry. This is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) by default but it can be *any* registry you specify.

One important thing to know is that any time you build a service, such as *demo*, it will automatically spin up containers for every dependent service. So if we build *demo*, we end up with three containers: one for the primary service, one for Redis and one for Postgres.

Also note that in this configuration example we are using the [healthcheck]({% link _pro/builds-and-configuration/services.md %}#healthcheck) version of our Redis and Postgres images to avoid startup timing issues.

## Pick Your Steps To Run

Next up, we define what steps run in your CI/CD workflow. This is done through another simple .yml file that lives in your repo - `codeship-steps.yml`.  This file is nothing but a list of the commands you want to pass to the containers you defined earlier in your `codeship-services.yml` file.

With Codeship Pro, your containers are the CI/CD environment, meaning every command you run - tests, deployments, scripts - all run _inside_ of the containers you build. This means you have full control of your CI/CD environment because anything you need to do, whether it's use a particular version or orchestrate your production infrastructure, is as simple as defining a container that can accept the commands you need to run.

As one example, if you need to deploy to Heroku then you just need to build a container with the Heroku Toolbelt and then run Heroku deployment commands in your `codeship-steps.yml` file!

Let's take a look at how this works. Go ahead and create this file and add the following code:

```yaml
- name: ruby
  service: demo
  command: bundle exec ruby check.rb
```

Let's take a look at what's happening. First, there's just one step, and it has a name: *ruby*. This is the name attached to the step in the log output.

The step then launches one of the services defined in your `codeship-services.yml` file - in this case, it's launching the *demo* service. Now, if you remember, because we launched the *demo* service it's also going to launch the two linked services: *redis* and *postgres*.

Next we call a command inside our new *demo* container. We tell it to run the `check.rb` script we created and added to our Dockerfile earlier.

![flow chart of three containers and script]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gettingstarted/workflow.png)

As you'll recall, that script prints the version of *redis* and *postgres* - which it will do by checking the version of the services we launched via the declared dependencies on our original *demo* service.

## Run Your Build Pipeline Locally

Now -  let's see how all of this ties together. Open up a terminal and go to the directory with the files we created.

The first thing we'll do is run `jet validate`. This will instruct `jet` to verify that our files our correct. Once this passes and we know our files our configured without issue, we will run `jet steps`.

This will tell the Jet CLI tool to build the services in your `codeship-services.yml` file and then run the steps in your `codeship-steps.yml` file.

If everything is working, you should see something like this:

![Screenshot of terminal showing example]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gettingstarted/part1working.png)

And if you scroll through your logs, you should see the versions for *redis* and *postgres* printed just as `check.rb` instructs it to.

## Change Version

Now we'll take a look at one of the cool benefits of doing all of your CI/CD process with these simple files in your repo.

Open up `codeship-services.yml` and find the line where you define your *redis* service. Change `image: healthcheck/redis:alpine` to `image: redis:3.2.11`.

## Run Locally Again

Now switch back to your terminal and run: `jet steps` again.

Looking at the same logs as before, you'll see that now your *redis* service is launching an entirely new version! Changing your CI infrastructure is as simple as changing a few characters in a single file on your repo. This can be done branch by branch, build by build - making upgrading, testing and iteration as easy and risk-free as possible.

## Next: Adding Tests

Now that we've covered the basics of how Codeship Pro uses Jet CLI, `codeship-services.yml`, `codeship-steps.yml` and containers to create a flexible, powerful CI/CD process, we'll move on to explore some more robust examples.
