## What Is The Dependency Cache?

On all Codeship Basic projects, we automatically cache the dependency directories for several popular tools and frameworks to speed up future builds.

This means that all packages saved in these directories at the end of a build will be automatically loaded on the build machine for future builds.

## Using The Dependency Cache

Any packages, up to 500mb, in the following directories at the end of your build will be automatically cached:

- `$REPO_ROOT/node_modules`
- `$REPO_ROOT/node_modules-cache`
- `$REPO_ROOT/tmp/parallel_runtime_cucumber.log`
- `$HOME/.virtualenv/bin/`
- `$HOME/.virtualenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages`
- `$HOME/.m2/repository`
- `$HOME/.ivy2`
- `$HOME/cache/yarn`
- `$HOME/cache/bundler`
- `$HOME/cache`

Also note that we automatically configure `bundler` to write into `~/cache/bundler` as well as `yarn` to write into `$HOME/cache/yarn`.

### Clearing The Cache

You can manually clear the cache either by removing the populated cache directory in your setup commands at the start of your build (for instance, by adding a startup command `rm -rf node_modules`), by using our custom `cs clear-cache` command in your startup commands or by clicking on **Reset Dependency Cache** on the right sidebar when viewing any build.

**Note** that when clearing your dependency cache, you should wait 30-60 seconds to let the system run before triggering your next build.
