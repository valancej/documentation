## Using A Custom Script

A custom script deployment is useful if your deployment requires additional or custom commands that are not available with some of Codeship's integrated deployment options.

A custom script deployment is also useful when you need to execute another task after or prior to a deployment. For example:

```shell
# Execute rake tasks
bundle exec rake my_rake_task

# Run additional tests
# my_test_script.sh lives in the root folder
./my_test_script.sh

# Deploy to Amazon S3 or any other server with ssh access
# You can define your keys with environment variables
```

Please follow these steps to create a custom deployment script:

#### Step 1

Navigate to your project's deployment configuration page by selecting _Project Settings_ > _Deployment_ on the top right side of the page.

![Project Settings Deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/project_configuration.png)

#### Step 2

Edit an existing deployment pipeline or create a new deployment pipeline by selecting + _Add new deployment pipeline_. Create the deployment pipeline to match the exact name of your deployment branch or a [wildcard branch]({{ site.baseurl }}/continuous-deployment/wildcard-deployment-pipelines/).
