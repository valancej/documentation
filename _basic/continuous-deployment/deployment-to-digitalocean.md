## Different Ways to Deploy
DigitalOcean offers virtual servers (called Droplets).
There are various ways to deploy your application to DigitalOcean.

## Capistrano
If you have a Ruby on Rails Application the most common way to deploy to DigitalOcean is Capistrano.
Checkout our article on [Capistrano Deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-capistrano.md %}) for that.

## SCP
A DigitalOcean droplet is very similar to a virtual server.
One way to deploy your application to DigitalOcean is to copy them via SCP to your Droplet.
