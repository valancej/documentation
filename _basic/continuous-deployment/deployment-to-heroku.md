Codeship makes it easy to deploy your application to Heroku using Codeship's integrated [deployment pipelines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/deployment-pipelines.md %}).

## Setup Heroku Deployment

### Step 1 - Navigate to Deployment Configuration
Navigate to your project's deployment configuration page by selecting _Project Settings_ > _Deploy_ on the top right side of the page.

### Step 2 - Add New Deployment Pipeline
Edit an existing deployment pipeline or create a new deployment pipeline by selecting + _Add new deployment pipeline_. Create the deployment pipeline to match the exact name of your deployment branch or a [wildcard branch]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/builds-and-configuration/deployment-pipelines.md %}#wildcard-branch-deployment-pipelines).

### Step 3 - Heroku
Select _Heroku_

### Step 4 - Deployment Configuration

#### Add SSH Key to Heroku
Get the public SSH key for your project under _Project Settings_ > _General_ and [add it to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/keys#adding-keys-to-heroku). If you miss this step you may see an error like this during the `git push` step of the deploy:

```
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

#### Application Name
Insert the name of the Heroku application you want the pipeline to deploy to.

#### Heroku API Key
In order for you to deploy your app using Codeship, you need to provide the Heroku API key from your Heroku account. You can access your Heroku API key [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account).

### Success!

You have now successfully setup deployment to Heroku. Go ahead and push a commit to your configured deploy branch.

## Additonal Configuration Settings (optional)
You can configure additional settings to your Heroku deployment by selecting **More Options**:

![Select Heroku Deploy Options]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/select-heroku-deploy-options.png)

![Heroku Deploy Options]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/heroku-deploy-options.png)

#### URL
After each deployment, we check your application to make sure that it is up. We will either call the default `*.herokuapp.com` URL or the URL you specified here.

If this URL requires **basic auth** please enter: `http://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_URL`

#### Restore
This takes a different Heroku app and will restore the database of the current Heroku application you are deploying to with the main database from the Heroku application posted here.

#### Backup Database
Backup your database before you deploy. See Heroku's [Creating a Backup](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-backups#creating-a-backup) page for more information.

#### Force Push
This causes git to disable some checks and can cause the remote repository to lose commits. Use this option with care.

See [git push -f](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) for more info.

#### Run Migrations (Ruby on Rails only)
You can specify to run the migration during the Heroku deployment. If you want to run your migration after the deployment, you can add a [custom script]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-custom-scripts.md %}) after the Heroku deployment and run the migration. If you are not using Rails you will need to use a custom script to run the correct migration command for your framework.

**Example**:

```shell
heroku run --exit-code --app ${HEROKU_APPLICATION_NAME} -- bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

#### Check app URL
This will enable your build to check the URL of your application to make sure that it is up.

## Troubleshooting

### check_url fails for Heroku deployment

After each deployment we check if your app is up. Therefore we call (`wget`) either the default `*.herokuapps.com` URL or the URL you specified here.

If the build fails during `check_url YOUR_URL` it's usually because your application does not respond with a HTTP/2xx status code at the URL you provided (or the default URL for the deployment if you didn't provide any).

**To solve this, you can:**

* Respond with a HTTP/200 status code at the root of your application.

* Configure a URL that will respond with such an status code in the advanced deployment configuration.

* Enter a generic URL(e.g. `http://google.com`) in the deployment configuration if you want to _disable_ the check entirely.
